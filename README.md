# BallR: Interactive NBA Shot Charts with R and Shiny



The data comes directly from the NBA Stats API via the `shotchartdetail` endpoint. See [fetch_shots.R](fetch_shots.R) for the API call itself. The player select input lets you choose any player and season back to 1996, so you can compare, for example, Michael Jordan of 1996 to LeBron James of 2012.
